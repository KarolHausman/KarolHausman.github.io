ABSTRACT="Although geometric routing is proposed as a memory-efficient alternative to
traditional lookup-based routing and forwarding algorithms, it still lacks:
i) adequate mechanisms to trade stretch against load balancing, and ii)
robustness to cope with network topology change.

The main contribution of this paper involves the proposal of a family of
routing schemes, called Forest Routing. These are based on the principles
of geometric routing, adding flexibility in its load balancing
characteristics. This is achieved by using an aggregation of greedy
embeddings along with a configurable distance function. Incorporating link
load information in the forwarding layer enables load balancing behavior
while still attaining low path stretch. In addition, the proposed schemes
are validated regarding their resilience towards network failures."
